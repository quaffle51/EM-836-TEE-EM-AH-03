Given $C=RM(2,4)$, which we note is of the form $RM(m-2,m)$, we can use the result of part~(c) above in determining an expression for $P_{undetec}(C)$.

Now, for $C=RM(2,4)$ and using the result of part~(c) we obtain the weight enumerator:
\[
W_{C^\perp}(z) = z^{16} + 140 \, z^{12} + 448 \, z^{10} + 870 \, z^{8} + 448 \, z^{6} + 140 \, z^{4} + 1,
\]
from which we obtain an expression (\hth{6.14}{64}) for the probability of an incorrect message being received undetected, $P_{undetec}(C)$:
\[
140 \, {\left(1-p\right)}^{12} p^{4} + 448 \, {\left(1-p\right)}^{10} p^{6} + 870 \, {\left(1-p\right)}^{8} p^{8} + 448 \, {\left(1-p\right)}^{6} p^{10} + 140 \, {\left(1-p\right)}^{4} p^{12} + p^{16}.
\]
We see from this last expression that when $p$ is small then $P_{undetec}(C)\approx 140p^4$. For the case when $p=0.01$ we obtain the rough estimate for the average number of vectors per undetected error is $0.000\,001\,4$. So only fourteen words in about $10\,000\,000$ will be accepted with errors undetected.
